"""
fair_value.py — spot-distance-from-strike fair-value signal (the Type-1 core).

Pure, shared by the live engine and the backtester. Given live spot, strike
(window open), time elapsed, vol, and the live contract prices, decide which side
(if any) is underpriced by at least the entry margin, classify the archetype, and
report a directional CONFIDENCE.

REBUILD (2026-06-09) — directional edge:
The old model was DRIFTLESS — P(up) depended only on how far spot had wandered from
strike vs volatility, so at the money (~50c) it was a coin-flip with no conviction.
That is exactly the band mentor PBot-6 makes most of his money in (23 of 30 wins at
46-54c) — because he has a real-time directional read. We now blend a momentum/flow
DRIFT into the probability (expected remaining return) and emit a CONFIDENCE score
(0-1) from the model's conviction, the edge size, and how many flow signals agree.
Confidence drives the ATM entry guard (app/main.py) and confidence-tiered sizing.

  P(up) = N( ( (S_t - S_0)/S_0 + drift ) / (sigma * sqrt((T - t)/T)) )

where `drift` is the EXPECTED REMAINING return (signed, return-fraction units).
At drift=0 this is identical to the previous driftless model (backtest-safe).
